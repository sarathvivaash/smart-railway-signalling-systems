# smart-railway-signalling-systems
🚄 Overview  
An embedded system project that prevents train collisions by detecting train presence and speed using IR and Ultrasonic Sensors, managed by an Arduino UNO.  
Dynamic signaling through LEDs (Green, Blue, Red) controls track safety in real time.

⚙️ Features  
- Real-time train presence detection  
- Train speed calculation (based on time between IR & Ultrasonic sensors)  
- Dynamic LED signaling (Safe / Caution / Stop)  
- Low-cost and scalable for basic railway traffic management
