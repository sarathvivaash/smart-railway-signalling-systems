Sensor Placement and Setup
Two IR sensors are placed near the entry point of each track to detect the presence of a train.
Two Ultrasonic sensors are placed after the IR sensors along the tracks to measure when the train passes, which allows us to estimate its speed.
Six LEDs (2 Red, 2 Blue, 2 Green) are used as signaling indicators for two tracks, one set for each track.

Train Detection and Speed Calculation
When a train passes the IR sensor, a timer is triggered.
As the train moves past the Ultrasonic sensor, the timer stops.
Using the time interval and the fixed distance between the two sensors, the speed of the train is calculated.

LED Signaling Logic
Green LED (Safe to Proceed): If a train passes on a track and the adjacent track is either empty or the approaching train is far and slow, a green signal is given indicating safe passage.
Blue LED (Caution – Slow Down): If a train is currently on one track and another train is detected moving slowly on the adjacent track, the system shows a blue LED on the second track, indicating the train should slow down to avoid potential collision.
Red LED (Stop – Collision Risk): If a train is already on one track and another train is approaching at high speed on the adjacent track, a red LED glows on the second track, indicating the train must stop to avoid a collision.
