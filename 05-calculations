1)Initialize all components:
Set up IR sensors with interrupts, ultrasonic sensors, and LEDs
Turn all signal LEDs off and prepare serial communication.
2)Detect train entry via IR sensor:
On falling edge of IR_A or IR_B, set a flag (calcA or calcB) to start monitoring distance using the respective ultrasonic sensor.
3)Start timing when train reaches ultrasonic sensor:
Continuously measure distance.
When distance â‰¤ thresholdDistance (7 cm) and > 2 cm, record startTime and begin timing.
Stop timing when train passes ultrasonic sensor.
When distance > thresholdDistance, record endTime.
Calculate train speed using speed = distance / time.
4)Repeat for both tracks:
Complete speed measurement independently for Track A and Track B using the same logic.
Compare speeds and determine priority:
5)If both speeds are available:
Compute absolute speed difference.
Use thresholds to decide which train gets priority (Green), and assign Red or Yellow to the other accordingly.
6)Update signal lights accordingly:
Set LED states (Green, Yellow, Red) for both tracks based on the decision.
Print the results to the serial monitor.

Formulae used:
speed = (sensorDistance in meters) / (time in seconds)

speed = 0.3 / ((endTime - startTime) / 1000.0) = 300 / (endTime - startTime)   [in m/s]
